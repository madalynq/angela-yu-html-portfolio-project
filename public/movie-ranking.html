<h1>Madalyn's Movie Picks</h1>
<h2>My current top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Beauty and the Beast, 1990</h3>
<p>
  This has been a favorite since I was young, I refer to it as a "comfort"
  movie.
</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>
  This was one of the first few Ghibli movies I watched, and the first one that
  I bought on DVD.
</p>
<h3>Insidious Chapter 2</h3>
<p>
  This made the list because it did a great job filling in the blanks, the first
  movive had left a <br />
  decent amount of things open-ended. Chapter 2 tied up things nicely.
